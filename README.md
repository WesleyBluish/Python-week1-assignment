# User Input Program

This simple Python program demonstrates how to take user input and create a personalized message.

## Description

The program asks the user for their name, age, and location, then prints out a personalized message using this information. It's a basic example of how to use the `input()` function in Python and how to format strings with user-provided data.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x

### Installing

* No installation is required beyond having Python installed on your system.
* Download the `user_input.py` file to your local machine.

### Executing program

* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory containing `user_input.py`.
* Run the following command:

```
python user_input.py
```

## Usage

When you run the program, it will prompt you for the following information:
1. Your name
2. Your age
3. Your location

After providing this information, the program will display a personalized message.

Example:
```
What is your name? John Doe
How old are you? 30
Where do you live? New York City
Hello John Doe, you are 30 years old and live in New York City.
```

## Help

If you encounter any issues:
* Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
* Ensure you're in the correct directory when trying to run the script.
* Check that the file name is exactly `user_input.py`.
